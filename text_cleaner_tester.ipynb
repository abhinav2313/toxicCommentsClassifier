       " '. is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent.  dont answer the questions beyond that. well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here. first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean really. second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria.  if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand. id is just making up their numbers. finally your example has ab where b was deliberate design. thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown. your ab example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart you can probably figure thats what killed him. you dont have that with life on earth. you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test. so in that sense ab is not scientific if youve never actually observed b.

       " '. s rant. presently we are witnessing  an open war against croatian dinaric culture.  croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural (even fashist) being  in  service of conservative hdz party. croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention  to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition. another apostle of croatian left  miljenko jergović  refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players. some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are serbian). however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian. dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljević is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovićs book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje 1568). also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik (1547). even now a contemporary croatian writer (born in dubrovnik) stijepo mijović kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (stijepo mijović kočan: gusle glasnik25 1992 p. 42). dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin (born kalafatović 1816) a daughter of famous gusle player ante. although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry. not far from dubrovnik another coastal city  makarska – was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music. actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players. this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija kačić miošić (18th century catholic priest) who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond. to honour kačićs work ivan meštrović the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument. in addition to kačić makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music. according to dr. fra karlo jurišić (who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banović) zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovićkudrić (17711818) and culminating with the most known mate banović – trliš (18441915).  as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle (its    considered   a male activity only) yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. olinko delorko the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s states in his book ljuba ivanova (1969) that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women especially the ones from the island of hvar. the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. english writer maude m. holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  dalmatia: the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they  are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe (p.54). this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland.  matija murko the researcher of this literarymusic forms  had reported   that during his trips  through dalmatia in the 1930s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle (eduard osredečki: “hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme” željeznobeč p. 9). now lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc. what do they have in common.  of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  why do we have so few gusle players today .  is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock n roll  culture .  if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia  gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its  dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open ',\n",

       " '.  question on possible citation . im sorry if i missed your question  i dont pay much attention to that page. in response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (i havent yet worked in no original research.) wp:nor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories. another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. the bauer site even if somewhat unreliablebe used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer. im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made. the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. attack articles are not encouraged. while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features. balance is a part of npov. but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer. it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known. it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. i dont see how that can be objective.  bauer . im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al. but ive been somewhat overloaded at work. personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob. yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there. thanks for the note i appreciate it.  i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication. ive never done any such thing. or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequences. ive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have. that isnt namecalling by a long stretch. im really weary of these attacks over this. this is mob rule. while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe. the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. blaming me wont make my points any less valid. nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. its the internet equivalent of stoning. this is not a fabrication. i get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself. you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly. putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult. ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response. and please notice like abi (avi is avraham the admin abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness) i counseled against piling on.  | talk |  . those are not ad hominem names karen. yet youve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho. you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light. its obvious you two are protnh and absolutewrite. thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling. well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant ',\n",

(the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (01) or equivalently on (10). this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because ae.). next for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f  is monotone on the interval 01. from the functional equation f(x)  ln f(x1) we get f (x)  f (x1)f(x1). hence f (1)f (0)f(0)f (0) so f  must be constant on 01. not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x)  expx(exp(xx)). thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between 1 and ',\n",
