      ". no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that if i really had my way half of you would be shot.  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much much better off if  of the population died tomorrow.  that doesnt mean i go around killing people or making specific death threats against individuals.  and dont you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says oh my god you are such a fucking idiot just go die already that they probably dont want you to die or more accurately they dont care.  very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  and i am not one of those people.  if you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person i am  edit which was on a wiki talk page is probably not the best.  granted nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is russian.  the cyrillic alphabet is used in many slavic languages as well as central asian former soviet republics and even mongolia.  so i called someone an idiot.  boo fucking hoo.  maybe he could have said what language is that.  instead of assuming that it was russian.  however insulted he was by me calling him an idiot i can guarantee you that i was at least  times as insulted by him calling that russian.  i am a proud native russian and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.  your other example how i am a bad contributor is what a spelling correction.   or was it the fact that my edit summary was how i felt about the sad fact that niggers cant spell.  dont even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  i live in harlem.  around here that word is used like a comma.  and before you try to tell me the difference between nigga and nigger there is none.  its called a dialect.  while for some purposes it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them i find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  also a nigger to me at least is not a black person. i am not a racist. i do not even draw distinctions between people. in my holy opinion there is a nigger inside of all of us.  people (like you for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean was saying black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society tarred and feathered strung up on trees dragged through town by their enormous wangs etc.    no.  and if that is what you heard id like to know why.  are you black.    of the black people i know personally use the word nigger more than i do.) are why we as a society still cant get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  words are not harmful.  ideas are harmful.  one particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  you want to end racism forever.   stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word nigger.  seriously.  i happen to be a priest (and a docktor) and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  fucks like you make me hate it but i still do it.  thats what a good person i am.  i forgot what else i was going to complain about.  i mean i could complain about everything on wikipedia not because i am uncivil but because there are enough wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal well adjusted individuals such as myself.  if you look at all my page edits they were all good for the encyclopedia.  ok there was one tiny exception   a long time ago i saw someone changed a caption on scottish fold to winston churchill.  someone else reverted it and i reverted it back.  i felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  but everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  ibe a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong but i only do what is right.  that is why i put it on my user page.  i dont do wrong things.  if you try to argue with me you will be in for a world of hurt.  butthurt to be exact.  but you have nobody to blame but yourself.  unlike you i actually warn people first.  but no.  you fags have to be humorless oversensitive fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self importance and your administrative powers.  well you can go fuck yourselves. if you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas.  i joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better and that was all i did.  but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro\n",

      "request to unblock. i began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before i was blocked. i suspect that user: auburnpilot had me blocked in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. although i was directed to request an unblock of user: physicq who had blocked me requesting such of the latter would require that i censor myself and write as though user: physicq had acted in good faith and was one of the good guys. that would be surreal and would give user: physicq a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. and so the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator but user: physicq but since i’m not a devious sort i have nothing against the latter reading this. indeed i want user: physicq to read it. for if i can be banned from wikipedia for standing up to censors then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting than to go down the long dark road of self abnegation and self censorship including the use of bad english. after all if i wanted to be a lackey i could go to graduate school.  wiki administrators’ notice board incidents.  user: auburnpilot.  a few days ago user: auburnpilot began stalking me checking wherever i had made edits and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. he or she has been manipulating wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. user: auburnpilot cannot even stand for wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. zero tolerance.  he claims of any source he politically dislikes that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “pov” another favorite dodge for those at wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own pov) even though the one source is a previously published classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the web (which the author has seen fit to publish on his web site and the other source is the longest most thorough exposé yet published on the duke rape hoax (. note that i am not even talking about censoring writing within articles since i hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: crystal gail mangum michael nifong  duke university lacrosse team scandal and racial profiling.  i’ve been involved in edit wars before though i have never been the aggressor and have never initiated an elective edit war though given the self assurance that aggressors such as user: auburnpilot exude perhaps i ought to reconsider that position. it seems that aggressors rule here.  the reason i am making a formal complaint is that user: auburnpilot has tonight upped the ante threatening to have me banned. (title user_talk:&redirect; no) if i do not surrender to his censorship. should you find for me please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease and desist order. should you however find for the censor please provide an index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.  p.s.    a est. since beginning this complaint i see that user: auburnpilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony user: physicq to block me thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (and no i am not going to use cutesy euphemistic language. if i were into such deception i would have become a liar er lawyer and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) and i was unable to e mail user: physicq because i am not logged in and “you must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e mail address in your preferences to send e mail to other users.” (. if this isn’t cyber stalinism i don’t know what is.  so let me get this straight. stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (user: auburnpilot’s penchant for saying “thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam disruption incivility and personal attacks.” if that is verily so then       .   the message here says that i was “temporarily blocked from editing wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” what the heck is that supposed to mean.  for restoring footnotes and links that user: auburnpilot had vandalized.  if that constitutes “disruptive edits” then you’ve utterly given up on honest english and all human decency. sorry but i don’t have any sympathy for the devil.\n",

      ".  penis envy. from wikipedia the free encyclopedia. jump to: navigation search. for the crass album see penis envy (album). for the virgin  documentary see . envy.  penis envy in freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. according to freud the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.  in contemporary culture the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.  contents. hide.      *  freuds theory.           o  criticisms of freud’s theory.                    within psychoanalytic circles.                    feminist criticisms.     *  male penis envy.     *  see also.     *  references.     *  external links.  edit freuds theory.  sigmund freud introduced the concept of a little girls interest in and envy of  the penis in his  article on the sexual theories of children but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in  when his work on narcissism was published. it was not mentioned in the first edition of freuds earlier three contributions to the theory of sex ().  the term came to significance as freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see psychosexual development).  in freud’s psychosexual development theory the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of  and ) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. prior to this stage the libido (broadly defined by freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. for instance in the oral stage in the first  to  months of life libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat sleep suck and bite. the theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. this becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. these events known as the oedipus complex for boys and the electra complex for girls result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.  for girls:.      * soon after the libidinal shift to the penis the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.      * the girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother since she does not have a penis.      * she desires a penis and the power that it represents. this is described as penis envy. she sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.      * she develops a sexual desire for her father.      * the girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.      * sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.      * the girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her and thus replace her.      * the child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis).     * the girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.  the offshoot of these events often cited in the media and colloquially is that a girl really wants to become her mother so that she can control her father.  a similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. the key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. the boy desires his mother and identifies with his father whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. furthermore the boy’s father being the powerful aggressor of the family unit is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.  freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen\n",

      ".   unblock request: fuck you unblock me.  {{unblockhahaahahahahahahaha unblock me or i will vandalise more.  it had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again. from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  having returned to my cozy semi secluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. with the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together: the three of us tight knit friends with benefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. then justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad; now they were much welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work. the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justines skin andhave also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder length brown hair. as when we were in college together she wore virtually no make up just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated. the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well toned thigh. the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  the conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. i took the opportunity to once again study beth and was equally impressed. while noticeably shorter than justine beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. as in college beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat tight sweater form fitting slacks and a pair of low heels. four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. beths black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine.  it felt so good to be in their presence once again. especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  the intimacy began when we finally went to bed.  together. i was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. an arm wrapped around each of them i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood. my eyes closed i reveled in their touches: inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  no words were needed. and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me i smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters. but eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. i stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee faint yet unmistakable. justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while beth and i held each other as sh\n",

      ".  reply from colonelhenry. i have been pissed this week i admit. why.   first last week i get harassed by one hypocritical rule nazi editor taking things too far (summerphd) so when i pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly this user is an asshole and explain why and state this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia i get blocked for  hours.  i say asshole once i get blocked.  she calls me a dick over a dozen times and gets warned.  go figure. i hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.   in the midst of that daniel case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of alonj that no one else raised as a concern (so not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to wait until after tfa and he still ignored it.  if someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention i would. because i find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. only when i responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize hey maybe i should wait till after tfa.  a little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  im not averse to his edits but seriously after tfa would have been more than fine.  i considered it insulting and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.   and then when the article ive worked on becomes tfa we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you kevjonesin insisting on th instead of nineteenth).  is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight.  seriously dont you have better things to do with your time.   id rather argue over an analysis of hegels influence on nietzsches will to power or hindu mysticism in eliots four quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled  or or  our.  as for why i like nineteenth as opposed to th several style guides (including chicagoturabian) advocates it and growing up i was taught that all numbers under  should be spelled out. whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to th and th is going to make a difference for brevitys sake on a  page article is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. i like the aesthetic of it spelled out its allowed and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  when considering such an unnecessary subjective edit deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article. and when nothing is wrong to it deference is entirely warranted.  that isnt ownership its just courtesy and good judgment. after all if i stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange youd tell me to kick rocks.  as far as im concerned this is over. move on. i am not addressing this any further because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave wikipedia again and this time for good. if hell is other people wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   \n",
