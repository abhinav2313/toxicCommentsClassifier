       " ' issues because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion and are usually very demanding on the mc members.  however issues between users such as wik theresa  vv etc.  are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.  it seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. arbitration is about punishment mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. it is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. and it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations threats insults and generally speaking attacks between users as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists.  i have a problem with this. the mc basically finds itself plagued by trolls and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. so how useful is the mediation committee .  id like to mention something. in real life people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. this cost is in particular that.  arbitration is a long process.  arbitration is costly.  arbitration is sometimes unfair.  i wonder if any arbitration on wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. apart from very specific cases of troll handling most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. if arbitration was more costly perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first before heading to punishement. perhaps should they be a cost whatever the outcome .  perhaps should the decision taken by the ac more costly in case there was refusal to discuss .  i believe that the concept of formal mediation here at wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  this isnt entirely the mediators fault but rather a process and structure problem.  contributing factors include:.  mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  once positions have been staked out publicly and in permanent media mediation is much more difficult.   to be effective mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  real world mediators are retired judges former statesmen former heads of corporations.  they are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion and balance.  the parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  the committee at present includes some members not known for this.  moreover wikipedians as a rule do not extend unimpeachable respect to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here).   mediation requests are presently public.  they should not be (c.f. meatball:getaroom) since it leads to playing to the court.   process is not yet fully decided (wikipedia:mediation committee) which discourages people who could potentially be helped; indeed the mediation releated pages have an unfinished essay like feel to them overall.   some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (getaroom again) since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a meatball:fishbowl.  the wp community should get over its all discussions public and archived forever fetish which is disfunctional.  consider the success of the irc channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ml).   there are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate and how to mediate.  wikipedia:mediation committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (you will then have to agree both on a mediator the mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation.  itbe necessary to send some people to mediation.  i can think of several cases where contributors could appropriately be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  lots of real world success with this.   we have a problem with some articles where carefully crafted compromises are undone by editors who werent involved in the original compromise which prevents healing.  i know of no good way around this but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.  i believe that the concept of formal mediation here at wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  this isnt entirely the mediators fault but rather a process and structure problem.  contributing factors include:.  mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  once positions have been staked out publicly and in permanent media mediation is much more difficult.  true. this said just a handful of people cant all the ti',\n",

(see jessica jahiels website.) the commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  a car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards) and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.  as for feces true horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet and somebody needs to remove it from the road. on the other hand it is not toxic the way lead is. once removed from the road it can be used to produce good compost.  even if people just leave it on a country road it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well compacted mass. leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long term contamination.',\n",

       " '.  i would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to nor even synonymous to cladistics. the difference between them is actually abyssal. phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity whereas cladistics instead is the opposite resting on the principle of subjectivity. phylogenetics partitions reality into categories (i.e. concepts) and discusses reality in terms of these categories whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories (concepts) exist and confuses them. what phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse. in line with this approach cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself (as a concept) with (the concept) phylogenetics and with (the concept) science. my empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space thereby denying that time can be relative to space which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space (see envall biol. j. linn. soc.  ). cladistics denies the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science that is objectivity.  deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics and in continuation for encyclopedias (which tries to keep concepts apart) and maybe also for science itself. instead the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence. there is still a big part of phylogenetics that is (practically) free from cladistic influence i.e. that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies that is the linnean system occupy a central position in phylogenetics.  a clensing of the article does however appear impossible in an open forum like this since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion. the power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them. one can easily envision how wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of germans during the :nd world war. nazism would certainly not have been described in condescending terms. this is a fundamental problem for wikipedia that needs to be addressed for wikipedia to retain reliability. a basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some (scientific) education. there has to be some captain(s) on the ship and they have to have some (scientific) education. otherwise wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess.  if wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can (and wants to) clean up the article i am prepared to do it. it does however require that i am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge. my neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to wikipedia but as i have tried to explain i consider a scientific approach (i.e. objectivity) to be neutral. the problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and denies objectivity since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity. there is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension. i instead counter the denial by falsifying it with empirical evidence. this does not counter deny cladistics but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts whereas objectivity (i.e. science) does. i thus show that cladistics denial of science does not agree with facts. this conclusion is not neutral but it is as neutral (or objective) as anything possibly can be. questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be. for me neutrality is equal to objectivity. (some claim that objectivity is impossible but i claim that it is not. this is however another story).  i thus advise against a deletion of the article and announce myself as willing to clean the article from cladistic influence (on the condition that im given certain authorities). mats envall (presently at   ).

       " '   .  thank you dave and thank you for your welcome on “my talk”.  “this section was started with discussion of bias in favor of darwins theory raising the issue of misrepresentation of darwin by anti evolutionists and as discussed above we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”.  i certainly agree with that.  but on the issue of using “realised” i just have a couple of things to say. but as a preamble if you like i want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (i’m not being insulting i assume everyone knows this already but i’m making a case). scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. but by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again i assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of karl popper).  now  i think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory or scientific fact and reality or truth. to say that “x realised that y” where y is a theory is suggesting that y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. now i think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality but i also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven remember according to popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective i already briefly outlined. of course in the case of evolution someone arguing like this sounds rather silly    it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. of course not all theories are the same   popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). but even if you wanted to make some exceptions like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” for the sake of scientific consistency i think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally in regards to making exceptions i certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by david wilson   these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).  anyway so much for theory. as far as concrete help is concerned have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether.   you probably know more about the history of evolution than i do but i thought that this idea didn’t actually come from darwin (i could be wrong of course). but if it does what about “charles robert darwin frs (   –   ) was an english naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this.  kind regards m.

       " '.   recent edits by user:ramorum .  ramorum please discuss your recent edits here instead of accusing me of vandalism for undoing your edit.  i will explain here why i think that your recent edit represents a violation of wp:npov and wp:nor.  you have changed the title of the section constitutionality to unconstitutionality and added a paragraph that reads:.  the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states constitution: article i which does not grant the congress of the united states the powers asserted in the  real id act. section  enumerates the powers authorized to the united states congress. the fourth amendment which states:  the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. the tenth amendment which states: the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people. the legal encyclopedia american jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality: the general rule is that an unconstitutional statute though having the form and the name of law is in reality no law but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it; an unconstitutional law in legal contemplation is as inoperative as if it had never been passed .  an unconstitutional law is void. ( am. jur. d sec. ).  these are fine legal arguments and i personally agree with them. but they clearly represent a personal judgement (correct as it itbe) on a controversial political topic. but that is not what wikipedia is about. wp:npov implies that statements of opinion such as the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states constitution are not appropriate in a wp article. it would be perfectly ok to say however something like critics charge that the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states and then provide a reference to some reliable source. where such criticism is raised. as your edit reads now not only does it represent a statement of opinion but the way in which this opinion is justified also in my view violates wp:nor. instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the real id act is questioned in the way you describe you list some general legal sources that in your view (and in mine)justify your opinion. this is a clear instance of original research that wp:nor prohibits.  there are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the real id act and i think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does. so if you want to make a constructive input please find such sources and add them to the article. regards   ',\n",

       " '  .   thanks for the compliment.  its true content is my main passion. i am happiest when doing lots of content creationediting and community building and i believe i do my best work when happy and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. i tend to go through cycles in my editing. recently theres been a great deal of content creation that interests me so thats what ive been most focused on. (a major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the wp community.) when i get less inspired on content i tend to go on recent changes patrol jump into an xfd or rfa debate etc. in my opinion it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content and make brief forays into administrative duties. i recognize that some hold differing views; to them i would say its essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use other projects like commons and wikinews deletion debates mediation etc. to act accordingly. i certainly feel that i have enough experience with that stuff. i have nominated numerous articles for deletion using speedy prod and afd procedures; i dont know a good way to assess the results but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. i do lots of vandalism reversion and would estimate that i include substed  templates about  of the time. i have recommended the occasional block for stuff like rr. i participate in cfds and ifds. im familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); i would not claim to know any by rote but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.   so i would make no promises to be the most productive wielder of the mop but i would make every effort to be well informed and judicious in my use. i suppose my main use of the tools would to drift over to category:administrative backlog at the times that i presently look at recent changes and do whatever needs doing.

(. ) site which tells us that protestant polish people took refuge there in the s. we all know that the counter reformation and the jesuits convinced the silesians and others to re catholizise. perhaps that is where johann dzierzon had gotten his surname from.  you like to forgot that orginal population of silesia was polish people. look for “recoveret teritories” article. the orginal polish language survived for hundred od years. (it is not exceptional facts you can found such event on lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) as you can imagine because the schools were fewer.  i have not seen any self description of him by himself as a pole.  i am not surprised of it. german do not publicized such thinks. you need read polish. you have editions by polish authors in english. you can find them in “literature” sections. also you disbelieve recent polish authors but you believe on nsdap propagandists karl fleischer (his editions are   years old). i ask many times for recent german beekeeping historians who says jan dzierzon was german.  the wikipedia polish group lead by a serafin who is also nr.  are the only ones with a note from a  book which is added to the incorrectly named jan dzierzon wikipedia article.  the correct name of jan dzierzon is dzierżon the z is with dot above. “dzierżyć” means to keep in polish language. what do you mean a note from . all polish beekeeping historians says dzierzon was polish. you just disregard parts which are inconvenient.  this not only claims that he said that but insisting on that he actually did say that. where is the actual proof.  in kluczbork museum. there is many more interesting thinks about the polish dzierzon family and their testimonies. i will encourage you to find proof of yours statement jd was german. nobody yet give me one except the nsdap propagandists karl fleischer scribbles. autobiography do not say anything of such we already know it is not.  that quote supposedly from himidentifying himself as a polish person actually just says that his surname is a polish based surname.  the citation say: “regarding my nationality i am obviously just as my name says polish of birth since on silesia people speak polish…” in polish version is: samo moje nazwisko mówi żem polak z urodzenia which is “just my name says i am pole of birth” further the sentence says: “because from  birthday i found myself in breslau and i studied there i become german educated but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” i did not include the other part before as i avoided irritating germans chauvinists. now you have it.  original polish text: „co do mojej narodowości jestem oczywiście jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi polakiem. z urodzenia gdyż na śląsku mówi się po polsku a że od  roku życia znalazłem się we wrocławiu i tam studiowałem stałem się niemcem z wykształcenia. ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”. original in museum of. j. dzierżona in kluczborku sygn.    folge zur charakteristik dr. j. dzierzon.  are you really assume that prussia was an asylum of tolerance and love.  if so you would be surprise. dzierzon did not have a reason to love prussia.  now on',\n",
