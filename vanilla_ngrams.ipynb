       " '.   unprotected . im going to edit based on my comments in talk:new_anti semitismsourcing_claims_for_.country specific_incidents so could we discuss them now.  all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti semitism i.e. coming from the left related to radical anti zionism etc.  theywell be but they are not sourced that way.  i dont think we can expect the words new anti semitism to appear in every single report we reference. weve defined it and weve linked to many sources who are defining it. the definition is:.  it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left. it is characterized by the demonization of the worlds only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion. israels right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. the jewish peoples right of self determination is denied. double standards are applied whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state. symbols and images associated with classic anti semitism are used: for example blood libels are resurrected the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world or being in control of other governments or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. arab and islamic anti semitism are excused and ignored. straw man attacks are made whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti semitism and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable and to deny that there is any such thing as the new anti semitism. all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools particularly in europe. it is found in conjunction with anti americanism (because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government) anti zionism and the anti globalization movement.  all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components so when we find them we can offer them as examples so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti semitism or attacks on jews.  my worry is that livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti semitism and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti semitism against his supporters.  add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti semitism (not reporting others allegations) which is or (and unwise in the case of galloway).  the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti semitism so id just want to tidy that up.  livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it) as has galloway and without question his supporters. the section talks about it in relation to that election. by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  slim whose definition is this.  all the sources put together. the above are the issues they agree on. it was posted weeks ago.  i think you mean all the sources from one side of the argument put together.  its been a while since we discussed this so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative.  sorry youll have to look in the archives; theyre either there or in the article. by all the sources i mean all the sources who study new anti semitism. the above are the elements they appear to agree on.  im asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative.  please respond.  user:c',\n",

       " 'did christians invent satan.  the idea that christians invented satan is lies propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job so why blame the christians.  rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent who had refused to worship adam also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan (old testament  samuel) later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul (satan) by pharisees jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees. in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west. so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st. michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels revelation also reveals woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short.  also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. christ was tempted by the shaitan  times after his baptism in the desert. so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious. the devil had pride then disobedience then jealousy then slander then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar murderer and thief.  why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions.  why so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists. even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara who was a tempter. jesus even spoke to st. peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st. peter like wheat whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation. the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven who became too full of himself later whe god created man in his own image god requests all the angels to bow to adam all do except for one angel (later called lucifer). he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay however god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job some mention that in isaiah: o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil but i also consider it to babyloon as in revelation fallen fallen is babylon the great etc. revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. god has talks with the satan so satan can not be inferred thence to be a non entity as god does not talk to non entities. also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil others realise that this is negative non sense. i know that people were possessed by demons fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming ha jesus you nazorean what hast thou to do with us hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us.  jesus then would tell the demons to shut up or be quiet.  so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible some truth is also in the quran.  there are some truths to be found also in other religious books but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit. have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god.  enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits. pagans invented their gods and invented strange myths concerning their false gods.  jews and christians had the opposite god revealed to them the truth and the way and the life.  thanks. email: . the next seion is not written by me (james hernon)',\n",

() that particular opinion has originated from a single source (mr. klebnikov) whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. () the publication (forbes) which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. () dozens of profiles of mr. berezovsky in major world newspapers which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism   including serious russian sources   do not repeat these allegations. i believe that wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. the revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced which was then discredited. of course if anyone can quote another reputable source which supports this opinion with evidence it should be mentioned. since i am going on vacation i have put the revised text on the main page and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via history tag) amend challenge and comment   as long as it is done by the rules. the last thing i want is another edit war. on the other hand seeking consensus is just one of wikipedia rules. avoiding pushing opinions and removing unsourced slander is another.

(a noted lack of source on this in the document is noted here.  it amounts to hearsay.)  the mstgw article speaks against applying labels such as msm and categorizing people.  this would include the msm label.  that the article specifically refers to these individuals as mstgw and not msm is a good indicator that tg individuals would be non msm.  lastly the hiv releated tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as balls. these social networks include houses (i.e. a guild providing a social framework for young msm and transgender persons) that exist in many large u.s. cities (house leader personal communication ). all four also were commercial sex workers.  this is clear information pointing to that these individuals were drag queens.  my conclusion.  i have to admit ive been viewing tg too narrowly and excluding individuals that are tg yet also msm.  however that doesnt mean that ts individuals are msm.  its hard to argue that a drag queen isnt msm while it is hard to argue that a post operative mtf living a life in stealth is an msm.  please feel free to alter the document to reflect this information.

(then the official reports must be lies too.) as i know the fuel has to be mixed with airoxygen in some proportion to explode otherwise with a surface contact with air it fires slowly. however it is all to be investigate by an international commission. and about the balance in the article the only reliable theory is about  of contents and you say it’s too much.

(my emphasis here and below).  in fact a widely disseminated invitation to that same  program maharaji himself not only demonstrated knowledge of the millenial expectations but fanned the flames substantially.  thus he declared the program the most holy and significant event in human history and even hinted that it might have intergalactic significance:.  a letter from guru maharaj ji .  bonn germany .  dear premies .  first of all i would like to tell you about something of great importance to all of us. because we have realized this beautiful knowledge which is of great bliss to us all it is our duty to propagate it to the human race. for it is something they really need.  in the world there is suffering hatred and dissatisfaction. that fact does not need proof. it is understood by all that the world is passing through a great moment. no one has satisfaction of mind nor can they find the solution to this. the world is looking for the perfect master to come and reveal the perfect knowledge of god. there is a supreme energy constantly vibrating in everything making it survive and all the perfect masters coem to reveal this knowledge to people. we can attain all materialistic things and still not have peace for peace lies inside not outside in materialism.  as you all know millenium  is being prepared for now. this festival has been organized by divine light mission each year since  in the memory of the late satgurudev shri hans ji maharaji on his birthday. this year the most holy and significant event in human history will take place in america.  i think that millenium  is a point where we can really get together and enjoy the bliss bliss with all of our borthers and sisters who are premies; and also tell the world that we have received and realized the permanent service of truth consciousness and bliss which all the world is looking for in one way or manner.  to do this i really need your help. i really need the help of all the premies in all respects; physically financially and all other ways to make millenium  come off. this is a festival not for you or me. it is for the whole world and maybe the whole universe.  i hereby invite you to this divine festival of peace millenium  and request all premies to help me financially physically and spiritually to make the program manifest for all seekers of truth.  isnt it about time you all get together and help me bring peace to this earth.  blessings to you all .  sant ji maharaj .  it is clear when you contrast geaves claim with the documentary evidence that geaves bless his heart is playing the role of the typical cult apologist lying about his leader and blaming the followers the press anyone at all for the inexcusable laughable excesses of the cult.  whats particularly worrying about geaves im sure you can appreciate is that as a religious studies professor hes imbued with a certain authority that',\n",

       " '.   referencing .  referencing on wikipedia thanks to its primitive interface is a pain. there are a couple of ways to do it: one widely used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. the meridian hill park article has a start on references: its got a heading and a {{reflist}} template so youre partways there already. there are some extant citations in the text like{{citation title roads to diversity: adams morgan heritage trail url author cultural tourism dc date }} and {{cite weburl dyn. node cityguideprofile&id;  title meridian hill park: sports and recreation locations in washington dc on washingtonpost.coms city guide publisher  date  accessdate   }}. you can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in html like markup. you use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. when embedded in the text theyll cause notes to appear in the references section at the bottom of the page.  in the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has at the left a button that says cite. clicking it will show a drop down menu of citation references for web news book and journal references which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used) and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. often for book references you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference and just say smith p.  and go on.  my main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. a certain dryness is called for but theres an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. its an interesting exercise. perhaps not joe friday more like bill gannon.  have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. the policies on no original research is important since wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.  im certain youll have more questions please feel free to ask.
